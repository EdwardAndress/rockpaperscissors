##Friday Challenge for Week 5
-----------------

###This weeks challeneg was to take some minimally-functioning code, spruce it up to enhance user experience, deploy online using Heroku, add the New Relic* feature and, finally, make the place look nice using CSS.

*New Relic is a free add-on, available via Heroku, that allows you to monitor usage and performance of a web-app.  Performance is measured using a range of parameters including response times of the server and in reply to specific HTTP requests from browsers, which means one can address points in the design that might be bottlenecks and therefore lead to poor user experience.
